# Mapping for ETJump
Here you will find simple guide on how to start mapping for ETJump mod.

## Getting started
To start mapping it's recommended to make a clean ET install seperate from your regular ET install. This way you won't accidentally use custom assets provided by other maps in your map. A third, untouched install could also come in handy when creating a pk3. This install should only be used to test if you have included every custom asset in your pk3.

## Tools
To create maps, you need GTK Radiant. You can get it [here](http://icculus.org/gtkradiant/).

In order to play your own maps you create, you need ETJump server files. These are not included in pk3 that you download from a server, instead you need to download them from [ETJump website](https://etjump.com/).

It's also recommended to download a more advanced text editor. Some options are [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## ETJump mapping assets
ETJump assets include entities and shaders that are useful when creating maps for ETJump.
You can get the assets from [GitHub](https://github.com/etjump/mapping).

## ETJump mapping entities
While creating your map, you most likely want to use entities provided by ETJump. Along with explanations provided in entity file, you can check the documentation on how to use ETJump specific entities. See the full list [here](mapping_entities.md).
